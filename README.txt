--- Repository for SOFT352 coursework --- 

IMPORTANT - You are required to run the command "npm run complete-install" in order to use this application.
Due to the size of some of the npm libraries (like Headless Chrome/Puppeteer) I cannot upload it with the libraries included.

IMPORTANT - This project requires Node and Mongo to be installed (for the Server and the database respectively)

USEFUL SCRIPTS (to be run in the project root)
npm run complete-install - Installs all of the packages required for this application
npm run complete-test - Runs both the WebApp and Server tests
npm run generate-documentation - Generates JSDoc documentation for both the Server and WebApp. The generated documentation will be stored in Server/Documentation/JSDoc and WebApp/Documentation/JSDoc.
npm run eslint - Runs eslint on the Server and WebApp files using my configuration and .ignore files.


This Repository contains the files for the Collaborative Book Reader.

This is split into two main Areas, Server and WebApp:
Server contains all of the files required for the NodeJS server.
WebApp contains all of the files required for the Website.
